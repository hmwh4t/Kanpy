## Core Classes

### Data Model Classes
- **`Card`**: Represents individual tasks with properties like name, description, deadline, priority
- **`ListObject`**: Represents columns/lists containing multiple cards
- **`Board`**: Container for multiple lists, represents a single board view
- **`Workspace`**: Container for multiple boards, represents a project workspace
- **`Bin`**: Recycle bin for temporarily storing deleted items

### Management Classes
- **`WorkspaceManager`**: Handles workspace creation, loading, saving, and file system operations
- **`EncryptionHelper`**: Provides password-based encryption/decryption functionality

### UI Classes
- **`KanbanApp`**: Main application class (renamed to KanpyApp in future updates)
- **`WorkspaceScreen`**: Displays available workspaces
- **`BoardScreen`**: Main board view with lists and cards
- **`BinScreen`**: Recycle bin interface
- Various popup and widget classes for UI interactions

## Data Storage

### File Structure
- **Master Config**: `workspaces.json` - Registry of all workspaces
- **Workspace Data**: `workspaces/{name}/data.json` - Individual workspace data
- **Encryption**: Encrypted workspaces store binary data instead of JSON text

### Data Format
Workspaces are stored as JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Workspace Name",
  "last_edited": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "boards": [...],
  "selected_board_index": 0
}
```

## Development

### Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation between data models, views, and controllers
- **Event-Driven**: Kivy's event system handles user interactions
- **Modular Design**: Separate files for data classes and UI logic

### Key Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation from dictionary data
- **Observer Pattern**: UI updates when data changes
- **Command Pattern**: User actions trigger specific methods

### Extending Kanpy
- **New Features**: Add methods to existing classes or create new widget classes
- **Custom Themes**: Modify `APP_COLORS` dictionary in `main.py`
- **Additional Fields**: Extend `Card` class and update serialization methods

## Security Notes

- Passwords are never stored permanently - only kept in memory during active sessions
- Encryption uses industry-standard PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Encrypted data is stored as binary files, unencrypted as readable JSON
- Workspace deletion permanently removes all associated files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
2. **Permission Errors**: Check write permissions in application directory
3. **Corrupted Data**: Invalid workspace entries are automatically cleaned up
4. **Font Issues**: Kanpy falls back to default fonts if custom fonts aren't found

### Data Recovery
- Workspaces are automatically backed up in the `workspaces/` directory
- Manual backup: Copy entire `workspaces/` folder and `workspaces.json`
- Recovery: Restore backed up files to application directory
